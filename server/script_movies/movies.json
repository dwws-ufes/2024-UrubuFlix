Produced by DMK politician J. Anbazhagan, the film stars Jayam Ravi in the titular dual role along with Neetu Chandra, Saiju Kurup and Sudha Chandran. The film follows Aadhi, a Thailand-based gangster living separately from his mother and sister due to his criminal activities. His life changes when he rescues a young waitress from goons and soon finds himself drawn in a violent conspiracy hatched by Bhagavan, his Mumbai-based lookalike. The cinematography was handled by R. B. Gurudev and K. Devaraj, while Ram Sudharsan edited the film. The film features a background score from the 2011 Telugu-language film Panjaa composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, who composed the music for both the films. It also features a Hindi-language song Agadam Bagadam sung by Mohit Chauhan. It is the second Asian film to make use of Auro 3D audio technology after Vishwaroopam. Following a formal announcement in February 2010, the film was in production for a period of three years and filmed primarily across Thailand, in the Indian states of Rajasthan and Goa, as well as the locales of Chennai, Mumbai, Toronto, Ontario and Canada. The film had to undergo a title change following protests from Hindu religious groups. The film also faced censorship issues as the Central Board of Film Certification gave it an A (adults only) certificate in spite of 24 cuts. The film was released theatrically on 22 February 2013 and received mixed reviews from critics. The action sequences and Ravi's performance were praised, but the writing was criticized. In spite of its moderate box office success, the director Ameer announced a sequel. In 2014, Neetu Chandra won the award for Best Actor in a Negative Role (Tamil) at the 3rd South Indian International Movie Awards.",

Both films are directed by Anthony and Joe Russo from screenplays by the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and feature an ensemble cast composed of many previous MCU actors.
